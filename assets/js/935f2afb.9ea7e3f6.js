The evaluation clearly removed degradations and showed that a higher ratio might get better low-light enhancement and with enhancement implementation, we could get higher PSNR and SSIM which represented better performance.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"evaluation":{"id":"evaluation","title":"Evaluation","description":"This is test text.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction":{"id":"introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"In this project, the goal is to explore and research how we could use deep learning to enhance low light images. Low-light image enhancement has wild applications in our daily life and in different scientific research fields such as night surveillance, automated driving, fluorescence microscopy, etc. This technique can improve the usefulness of an image to satisfy human viewing. Also, it can make low-light images applicable for applications in autonomous driving, scientific data capture, and general visual enhancement. For example, self-driving car can see humans in the dark environment to prevent accidents from happening with this technology. Therefore, low-light image enhancement is very significant and is worth studying. With more application applied machine/deep learning methods for improvement, we\u2019d like to research how to use deep learning to enhance low-light images.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"method":{"id":"method","title":"Method","description":"This is test text.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"midterm-report":{"id":"midterm-report","title":"Midterm Report","description":"Open in a new window","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"project-proposal":{"id":"project-proposal","title":"Project Proposal","description":"Open in a new window","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"reference":{"id":"reference","title":"Reference","description":"* [1] \u201cAwesome Low Light Image Enhancement\u201d.
