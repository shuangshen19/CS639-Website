Our model is also trainable without the ground truth of illumination and reflectance layer. The evaluation clearly removed degradations and showed that a higher ratio might get better low-light enhancement and with enhancement implementation, we could get higher PSNR and SSIM which represented better performance.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"evaluation":{"id":"evaluation","title":"Evaluation","description":"Our goal is to achieve the result presented in Kindling the Darkness: A Practical Low-light Image Enhancer[5] from Zhang et al.

Low-light image enhancement has wild applications in our daily life and in different scientific research fields such as night surveillance, automated driving, fluorescence microscopy, etc. This technique can improve the usefulness of an image to satisfy human viewing. Also, it can make low-light images applicable for applications in autonomous driving, scientific data capture, and general visual enhancement. For example, self-driving car can see humans in the dark environment to prevent accidents from happening with this technology. Therefore, low-light image enhancement is very significant and is worth studying. With more application applied machine/deep learning methods for improvement, we\u2019d like to research how to use deep learning to enhance low-light images.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Method":{"id":"Method","title":"Method","description":"In this project, we adopt KinD algorithm proposed by Zhang et al. [5] to build a low-light image emhancer. It is a CNN-based approach and the original implementation is on TensorFlow. We re-implement the algorithm by using Pytorch and do the experiment on LOLdataset [6]. In this section, we will introduce the network, training scheme, and inference procedure.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"midterm-report":{"id":"midterm-report","title":"Midterm Report","description":"Open in a new window","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"project-proposal":{"id":"project-proposal","title":"Project Proposal","description":"Open in a new window","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"reference":{"id":"reference","title":"Reference","description":"* [1] \u201cAwesome Low Light Image Enhancement\u201d.

Decomposing images in the Retinex manner consequently decouples the space of mapping a degraded low-light image to a desired one into two smaller components. To better learned, based on illumination map which is main functionality to flexibly adjusting light exposure and reflectance map, the Retinex-based layer decomposition is suitable and necessary for the target task in KinD Algorithm.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"src":{"id":"src","title":"Source Code & Presentation","description":"Source Code","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
